## ABOUT

SpotGuide is a webapp based on an interactive map. The various surf spots are indicated on the map by markers. If you click on a surf spot marker, a pop-up window opens with a picture of the surf spot and a short description. If you click on the popup, you get to the detail page of the surf spot.
You can change the map position to the user's location via the header or enter a location and search around it.
You can also use the header to switch to the menu in which the spots are displayed in a list sorted by country. In addition, you can then switch to the profile page via the header, where you can log in with your Github account to add new spots.
The detail page of a surf spot is divided into an information page and a social page. Users can leave comments on the spot on the social page. On the information page, the user will find all relevant information about the surf spot.
