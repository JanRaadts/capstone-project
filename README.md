## ABOUT

The FamilyHub facilitates the organizational daily life of the peer group. With any number of registered users in a peer group, the app is particularly concerned with getting an overview of one's notes as easily as possible without getting bogged down in one's message groups. Each user has his own notes, which it can view, delete, edit and create from anywhere. Other planned features include a timestamp, a reminder function or the connection to calendar systems and the creation of multiple peer groups. The shared shopping list allows all users in the group to quickly and easily add items they need to the list.
